\begin{letter}{Prof. Eli Upfal\\ 
               Brown University\\ 
               Box 1910\\ 
               Providence, RI 02912}

\opening{Dear Sir,}

This is my statement of purpose and could be a cover letter as well. I am currently writing this during the covid pandemic as well as the wwiii in Ukraine and Russia at an urgency. Inflation is crazy so I'm just trying to live. 

This could be a long or short letter, but at the end of the day I repeat this statement of purpose to myself everyday...even though it's been four years since I dreamed of writing this. 
\closing{Sincerely,}

\ps{Please see the enclosed file.}
